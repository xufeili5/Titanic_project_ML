# Titanic Project ML
This repo is for the Titanic Kaggle competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

The `Titanic_project_ML.ipynb` file trained 3 models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVMs - and then used the best performing model to predict survivors (0s/1s).

The `Titanic_Random_Forest.csv` is the output of the predictions.
